# Module 4 Python and Pandas Challenge: School District Analysis
---
A supervisor in charge of evaluating the district budget for the following year has asked for a school district analysis using Pandas in Python. In order to make the best decisions for the budget for the coming year, it is important to omit any results regarding the math and reading scores of ninth grade students at Thomas High School as to not skew the data. Likewise, it is important to compare each school's budget with the math, reading, and overall grade outcomes of the students based on different factors like the school size, type of school, and etc.

- The **district summary** is unaffected by the new analysis shown above because there were no new scores of reading or math added in this analysis, and no existing scores of reading or math were removed in this analysis.
- The only difference between the new analysis and the older analysis is the formatting of the numbers (see the below image to see the format of the older analysis' numbers)
